# VoidWare

## ‚ö° What is this?

VoidWare is a lightweight, stealthy client-server setup that captures 3 quick snapshots and location from a consenting user, shoots the data to your Telegram bot, then ghost redirects them to TikTok to cover your tracks.

Perfect for legit pentesting or controlled demos where you want clean, fast data grabs without raising alarms.
